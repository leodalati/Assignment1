that works across different devices (mobile, tablet, and laptop).

The website includes:
- A navigation bar
- An "About Me" section with text and images
- A video section
- A contact form

What This Project Demonstrates

This project demonstrates the use of several core web design concepts:
- Navigation Bar – simple internal page linking
- Images – with alignment and wrapping text around them
- Videos – embedded video with play/pause controls
- Buttons – interactive elements for user control (e.g., video playback)
- Forms – labels, placeholders, and input fields for user data
- Responsive Design – fluid layout with separate CSS files for mobile, tablet, and laptop
- Accessibility – alt text, semantic HTML, and validation for user-friendly browsing
